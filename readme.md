# ðŸš€ Full Stack Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Learning in Public Journey** where I document my progress as I learn and practice **Full Stack Development (MERN Stack, Next.js, and DevOps)**.  
This repository will include **daily notes, mini-projects, and resources** I use along the way.

## ðŸ“Œ About This Journey
I have started with **consistency, structured learning, and public sharing**.  
My focus is:  
- Strengthen **JavaScript fundamentals** (with projects)  
- Learn & build with **Next.js**  
- Master **MERN stack** through real-world projects  
- Explore **DevOps basics** (Docker, CI/CD, Deployments)  
- Share progress daily on **LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram**
